# 🎲 Risk & Roll — A Dice Game

**Risk & Roll** is a two-player browser-based dice game inspired by the classic *Pig Game*. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, this game was developed as part of my hands-on practice while learning JavaScript through Jonas Schmedtmann’s course.

The goal is simple but strategic: **Roll the dice and risk it all, or hold your score and play safe!**  
Perfect for understanding DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and maintaining game state in JavaScript.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Two players take alternate turns.
- A player can **roll** the dice:
  - If the result is not 1, the number is added to their *current score*.
  - If they roll a **1**, their current score resets and it's the next player's turn.
- A player can **hold** to save their current score into their total.
- First to reach **100 points** wins the game!
